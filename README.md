# Saurav's DSA Templates :computer: :sparkling_heart:

The repository holds the implementation of many basic and advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. Feel free to fork the repo and use
it for Problem Solving or Competitive Programming or simply understanding and modifying the implementation.

## DSA Contents :snowflake:

### Supported Data Structures :tada:

1. Binary Tree
2. Graph Concepts

### Supported Algorithms :high_brightness:

1. Binary Tree
    1. Building a Binary Tree from an Array.
  
2. Two Pointers
    1. Two Pointer approach for Rain Water Trapping problem 

3. Graph Concept
    1. Making a Directed Graph
    2. Building a Weighted Directed Graph

4. Disjoin Union Set
    1. Union by Size
    2. Path Compression
    3. Finding Connected Components
       
4. Fast IO for taking inputs in huge amount. Suited for Competitive Programming.

5. Helper Methods:
    1. A method which takes input a list of integers from the user and returns an array of integers.
