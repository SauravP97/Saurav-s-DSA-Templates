3. Graph Concept
    1. Making a Directed Graph
    2. Building a Weighted Directed Graph
    3. Computing Shortest Path - Dijkstra's with Min Heap (Optimised)

4. Disjoin Union Set
    1. Union by Size
    2. Path Compression
    3. Finding Connected Components

6. Trie / Prefix Tree
    1. Implementation
